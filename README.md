# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction

This project predicts whether a customer will churn (leave a service) or stay, using machine learning models like **Decision Tree**, **Random Forest**, and **XGBoost**.  
The dataset is preprocessed, categorical values are encoded, and class imbalance is handled using **SMOTE**.

---

## ⚙️ Features
- Data preprocessing & cleaning  
- Label encoding for categorical values  
- Handling imbalance with SMOTE  
- Model training with multiple algorithms  
- Cross-validation for evaluation  
- Final evaluation on test set  

---

## 🚀 Models Used
- **Decision Tree Classifier**  
- **Random Forest Classifier**  
- **XGBoost Classifier**

---

## 📈 Results
Models are compared using **5-fold cross validation** and evaluated on the **test dataset** with:
- Accuracy  
- Confusion Matrix  
- Classification Report
